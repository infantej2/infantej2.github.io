      <h4>We believe people need space to create. But in the attention 
        economy, noise and distractions are eroding that space. Our name
        originates from the 53 centimeters that connect head, heart, and
        hand—the personal canvas for creation. For as long as they’ve been
        creating, humans have found that tools—of bone, bronze, or silicon
        —are vital to making ideas tangible. As a company, our goal has
        been to create digital tools that are designed to encourage human
        creativity and create the space to make great things. Our products
        focus on the essential: creating an environment of focus, one that
        reduces noise and allows visual thinkers’ ideas to flow.

      <h4>
        Our first product, Paper, is an immersive drawing app for capturing
        ideas anywhere. Over 25 million people have found their creative
        space in Paper—sketching and writing hundreds of millions of ideas.
        As technology has advanced, we have re-made Paper, continually
        measuring it against the question “What is essential?” Paper 4.0 is
        an entirely rebuilt app for iOS 11 with a renewed focus on beautiful
        simplicity and getting visual thinkers directly into the act of
        creation.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        For individuals, Paper is an indispensable tool in their personal
        creative process. We sought to bring the same focus and space to a
        new audience: the modern team. Modern teams, who collaborate
        digitally and use diverse types of content, are the storytellers of
        today and the inventors of tomorrow. Embracing disruption, they
        need new technology that adapts to the way they work—closely and
        fluidly, valuing quickness over perfection, and requiring tools that
        are versatile, yet considered—tools with a point of view.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paste is FiftyThree’s answer for modern teams—a presentation tool
        that reflects their values and way of working combined with our
        unique perspective on essential tools. Paste is a collaborative way
        for you and your team to build ideas into compelling stories.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        In August 2018, FiftyThree joined WeTransfer with the shared belief
        in the power of creative thinking as a positive force for humankind.
        For us, it’s an exciting continuation of our mission; one we're looking
        forward to sharing with you.
